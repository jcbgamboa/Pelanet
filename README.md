# Pelanet

# What?

Pelanet is an implementation of Neural Networks algorithms in C++
using some of the Boost libraries.

[is <- is going to be]


# Why?

The goal is to have an easy to understand implementation of the most
common Neural Networks algorithms. The idea is to use these
implementation to explain some topics on Neural Networks to people who
want to learn about them.

## "Easy to understand" in C++?

Another of the goals is to, while implementing stuff, get acquainted
to some of the Boost libraries.

[come on... C++ is not that bad =) ]

# How?

## Building...

[notice that we obviously need boost]

## Running...
